                    <p class="gem__text">After graduating from Exeter in 2002, Zuckerberg enrolled at Harvard University. After his sophomore year, Zuckerberg dropped out of college to devote himself to his new company, Facebook, full time.
By his sophomore year at the Ivy League institution, he had developed a reputation as the go-to software developer on campus. It was at that time that he built a program called CourseMatch, which helped students choose their classes based on the course selections of other users.
He also invented Facemash, which compared the pictures of two students on campus and allowed users to vote on which one was more attractive. The program became wildly popular, but was later shut down by the school administration after it was deemed inappropriate.</p>

                    <p class="gem__text">Pump's big breakthrough arrived in 2017 with the explosion of his single "Gucci Gang," which rose to the Top Three of the Hot 100 by the end of the year and was certified triple platinum. He issued his debut mixtape, Lil Pump, in October, featuring appearances by Smokepurpp, Gucci Mane, Lil Yachty, and more. The effort hit number three on the Billboard 200 and rose to number two on the R&B/hip-hop chart. Later that year, Pump scored another hit with the booming "Welcome to the Party," a collaboration with Diplo, French Montana, and Zhavia Ward that landed on the Deadpool 2 soundtrack.</p>
